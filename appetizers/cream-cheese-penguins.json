  "ingredients": [
    "18 jumbo black olives, pitted",
    "1 8oz pkg cream cheese, softened",
    "18 small black olives",
    "1 carrot"
  ],
  "instructions": "Cut a slit from top to bottom, lengthwise, into the side of each jumbo olive. Carefully insert about 1 tsp cream cheese into each olive. Slice the carrot into eighteen 1/4 in thick rounds; cut a small notch out of each carrot slice to form feet. Save the cut out piece & press into center of small olive to form beak. If necessary cut a small slit into each olive before inserting the beak. Set the big olive, large hole side down, onto a carrot slice. Then, set a small olive onto the large olive, adjusting so that the beak, cream cheese chest & notch in the carrot slice line up. Secure with a toothpick. Can wrap 'scarf' of pimento or sliced bell pepper."
