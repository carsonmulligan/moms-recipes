First rise: shape dough into a smooth ball & place in a clean, lightly greased bowl. Turn dough over a few times to coat all sides with oil. Cover with clean towel. Let proof at room temp x 60-90 min until it has doubled in size. Topping: In a small bowl, whisk together melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, & flour. Set aside. Shape: After 1st rise, punch dough down & turn it out onto lightly floured surface. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces & form each piece into smooth balls. Shape each ball into a bagel by poking your finger through center while gently stretching dough into a ring. Arrange bagels on parchment-lined baking sheet & cover with towel. Let rest 10-15 mins. Water bath: Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Place a large pot on stove over high heat. Fill with 8c water & bring to boil. Whisk in 1/4 c honey & reduce heat to medium. Gently drop 2-3 bagels into water bath at a time. Cook for 2-3 mins, turning about 1 min. Remove using slotted spoon & return to parchment on baking sheet. Limit each baking sheet to 4 bagels. Bake: Whisk egg white & water & brush egg wash over tops & sides. Spoon on crunch topping. Bake 20-25 mins rotating pan halfway & pushing any topping that falls off back onto bagels.",
